# Advanced Geovisualization Final Project
This is the repository for the final project for Advanced Geovisualization, EAS 648
The project is a map made in R using Leaflet and hosted as a Shiny App on shinyapps.io.
It shows how much of each EU country's energy comes from renewable sources for each year with available data.
It also shows the percent change between any two years, and information about the EU overall.
You can view the map [here](https://akutsupis.shinyapps.io/eu_renewable_energy/).
